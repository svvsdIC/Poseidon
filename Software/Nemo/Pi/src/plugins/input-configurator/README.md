# Input Configurator Plugin

### This project is in BETA

The input configurator provides the APIs and UI widgets for remapping keyboard and gamepad controls in a web browser application.

TODO:
- [ ] Work on the reactive display of the control
- [ ] Add an indicator or filter for existing duplicates
- [ ] Presets should be overrides on the predefined controls such that new mappings can be defined in plugins and will still work
- [ ] Enable the invert axis checkbox
- [ ] Find a way to allow axis to be used as buttons and vise versa (make sure all apis take a value)
- [ ] Refactor presets to be more intuitive
- [ ] Separate the preset webcontrol from the keyboard/gamepad mapper
- [ ] Change the gamepad mapper to allow using the gamepad to select the button/axis
- [ ] Cleanup the configuration data so that preset maps are only the mapping, no descriptions 
- [ ] Make the webcontrols generic behaviors
