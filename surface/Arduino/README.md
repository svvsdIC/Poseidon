This directory has the tree for developing Arduino programs for the 
surface (Lulu) arduino.  This program will sense joystick positions 
from the radio receivers, and collect sensor data of the surface
sensors.  These are communicated to the Lulu-Pi via the USB serial
connection used both for serial comm and for program upload from the
Lulu-PI to the Lulu-Arduino-Uno.
